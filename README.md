# [micro:bit](https://microbit.org/get-started/user-guide/python/) Exploration

This is a repository that creates a microbit timer

## Who

Developed by Cam and Kamarri 

## What

Our code makes a timer on the micro bit. You hit A to add a second, B and then A to take away a second, and B then B to start the timer which has a clock animation. 

## How

We used the micro:bit capabilities and when you press A it adds one to a variable. When you press B it changes what both A and B do. Now A takes one away from the variable, and B will run the clock animation for the given amount of time in seconds. 

## Why

We made the design choices we made because we figured it would be most efficient. We decided that it would be best to have the B button change what the buttons do giving us 3 options instead of 2.
